Let's make configuration of ECS service for wordpress application having 2 number of instances in different AZ for maintaining HA and hosting with ALB and ASG services. For DB, create RDS SQL DB in private subnet of custom VPC.  


To set up an ECS service for a WordPress application with high availability (HA) using an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Auto Scaling Group (ASG), along with an RDS SQL database in a private subnet, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Custom VPC**:
   - Define a custom VPC with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

2. **Create RDS SQL Database**:
   - Define an RDS instance for the SQL database in the private subnet of the custom VPC.
   - Ensure the RDS security group allows inbound traffic from the ECS task security group.

3. **Set Up ECS Cluster**:
   - Create an ECS cluster within the custom VPC.

4. **Create ECS Task Definition**:
   - Define an ECS task definition for the WordPress application.
   - Specify container definitions for the WordPress application and any required environment variables, such as database connection details.
   - Ensure that the task definition uses the correct Docker image for WordPress.

5. **Create ECS Service**:
   - Define an ECS service for the WordPress application, specifying the task definition created earlier.
   - Configure the service to run multiple instances across multiple AZs for high availability.
   - Configure a target group for the ALB to route traffic to the ECS service.

6. **Set Up Application Load Balancer (ALB)**:
   - Create an ALB within the custom VPC, listening on ports 80 and 443.
   - Configure listener rules to route traffic to the target group associated with the ECS service.

7. **Set Up Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**:
   - Create an ASG to manage the ECS instances, ensuring that it spans multiple AZs for high availability.
   - Configure scaling policies based on metrics like CPU utilization to automatically adjust the number of ECS instances.

8. **Security Group Configuration**:
   - Define security groups for the ECS tasks, ALB, and RDS instances.
   - Allow inbound traffic to the ALB from the internet on ports 80 and 443.
   - Allow inbound traffic to the ECS instances from the ALB security group.
   - Allow inbound traffic to the RDS instance from the ECS task security group.
   - Restrict outbound traffic to only necessary ports and destinations.

9. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Configure DNS records (e.g., Route 53) to point to the ALB's DNS name for the WordPress application.

10. **Testing and Monitoring**:
    - Test the setup thoroughly to ensure the WordPress application is accessible and functions correctly.
    - Set up monitoring and logging for the ECS cluster, ALB, ASG, and RDS instance to monitor performance and troubleshoot issues.

By following these steps, you can set up a highly available WordPress application hosted on ECS with an RDS SQL database for data storage. The setup ensures resilience, scalability, and security for your WordPress application.

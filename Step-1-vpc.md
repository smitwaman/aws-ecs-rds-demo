Here are the detailed steps to create a custom VPC with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs):

1. **Navigate to VPC Dashboard**:
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the VPC dashboard.

2. **Create VPC**:
   - Click on "Your VPCs" in the left-hand navigation pane.
   - Click on "Create VPC".
   - Enter a name for your VPC.
   - Specify the CIDR block for your VPC (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
   - Click on "Create".

3. **Create Public Subnets**:
   - Click on "Subnets" in the left-hand navigation pane.
   - Click on "Create subnet".
   - Select the VPC you created in step 2.
   - Choose an Availability Zone (AZ) for the subnet.
   - Enter a name for your subnet (e.g., "Public Subnet 1").
   - Specify the CIDR block for your subnet (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24).
   - Click on "Create subnet".
   - Repeat this process to create additional public subnets in different AZs.

4. **Create Private Subnets**:
   - Follow the same steps as above to create private subnets.
   - Ensure that you choose a different CIDR block for each private subnet (e.g., 10.0.2.0/24 for "Private Subnet 1", 10.0.3.0/24 for "Private Subnet 2", etc.).
   - Also, ensure that you select different AZs for each private subnet to achieve high availability.

5. **Create Internet Gateway (IGW)**:
   - Click on "Internet Gateways" in the left-hand navigation pane.
   - Click on "Create internet gateway".
   - Enter a name for your internet gateway.
   - Click on "Create internet gateway".
   - Select the newly created internet gateway and click on "Attach to VPC".
   - Choose the VPC you created in step 2 and click on "Attach internet gateway".

6. **Update Route Table for Public Subnets**:
   - Click on "Route Tables" in the left-hand navigation pane.
   - Find the route table associated with your VPC (usually named "Main").
   - Click on the "Routes" tab.
   - Add a new route with destination 0.0.0.0/0 and target as the internet gateway you created in step 5.
   - Save the changes.
   - Associate this route table with your public subnets.

7. **Configure Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)**:
   - (Optional) If you need additional network-level access controls, configure Network ACLs for your subnets to control inbound and outbound traffic.

8. **Tag Resources**:
   - (Optional) Tag your VPC, subnets, and other resources for easier management and identification.

Your custom VPC with public and private subnets across multiple AZs is now set up. This configuration provides the foundation for deploying resources such as EC2 instances, RDS instances, and ECS clusters in a secure and highly available manner within your AWS environment.
